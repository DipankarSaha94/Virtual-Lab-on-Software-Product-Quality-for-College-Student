		<h3>Compatibility</h3>
				<p>Compatibility is the ability to live and work together without any discrepancy. Compatible product also work in the same setup i.e. Degree to which a product, system or component can exchange information with other products, systems or components, and/or perform its required functions while sharing the same hardware or software environment.</p>
				<h5>Expectation</h5>
					<p>Let's consider a website as software product. Now our expectation for this website would be, it is proficient enough to run in different browsers(like chrome, firefox, Internet Explorer) , operating system(like windows, MacOS), mobile devices(like android, IOS).</p>
				<h5>Example</h5>
					<p>For example, consider site Google.com, it looks same in all different browser and diferent operating system, so it is compatible. Now let's say you are given a website to build.After the build is complete, you observe that your website looks really good in Chrome  but when open form an another browser it changes. The reason is that some of the functions you have written for your website is only limited to some particular browser, then, you can say your website is partially compatible and in quality matric it won't earn you full score.</p>

				<h5>Practical Idea</h5>
				<h6>Scenario 1</h6>
					<p>For a Practice, copy the link address of this HTML file <a href="Sample_file/Test1.html" target="_blank">Compatible_Check File1</a> and try to open it from two different browser. It is a short code to create a form.<br>What did you see, it looks same in both the browser. right !</p>
				<h6>Scenario 2</h6>
					<p>Now, copy the link address of this 2nd HTML file <a href="Sample_file/Test2.html" target="_blank">Compatible_Check File2</a> and try to open it from two different browser. It a short code to create a 2X2 matrix. <br>Did you notice it looks diferent in two different broswer.</p>
					<p>And this idea can be extended for any product considereing different feasible parameter, like Mobile Application. You can read more about native and cross-platform Application.</p>
				<h5>Finally</h5>
					<p>Hope from this, now you have an idea about comaptibility which is one of the measure of product quality and what are the things you have to keep in mind while dealing or building a compatible product.</p>
