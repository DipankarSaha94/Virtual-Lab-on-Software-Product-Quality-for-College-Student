			<h2>Usability</h2>
			<p class="para">&emsp;Usability refers to the quality of a user's experience when interacting with products or  systems, including websites, software, devices, or applications. Usability is about effectiveness, efficiency and the overall satisfaction of the user.
				It is important to understand that usability is not a single, one-dimensional property of a product, system, or user interface. Usability is a combination of factors including:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Intuitive design - </b>A nearly easy understanding of the architecture and navigation of the software or website.</li>
				<li><b>Ease of learning - </b> How fast a user who has never seen the  user interface before can accomplish basic tasks ? </li>
				<li><b>Efficiency of use - </b> How fast an experienced user can achieve tasks in the system ? </li>
				<li><b>Ability to remember (Memorability) - </b> How can the user remember to use the system effectively in future uses ?</li>
				<li><b>Error occurrence and acuteness - </b>To  what extent  users make errors while using the software,  how serious the errors are, and to what extent users  recover from the errors ? </li>
				<li><b>User satisfaction - </b> To what extentthe user likes using the system ? </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="para">
				&emsp;Usability represents the measurement of the quality of a user's experience when interacting with a product, whether a web site, software application, mobile technology, or any user-operated device. If the product is difficult to use or fails to achieve a user requirement like a homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site, people leave. There is no such thing as a user reading a product manual or otherwise spending much time trying to figure out an interface.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				&emsp;Usability can be exploited by both users and developers. Users can benefit from usability since, users achieve their objectives effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, support confidence and trust in the product. When the users are satisfied, they become dependable, and may even recommend your product or service to others. As a developer, may benefit from usability in many methods, such as, reduced development time, costs, support costs, user errors, training time and costs.
